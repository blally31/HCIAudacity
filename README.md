# HCIAudacity

A group based project aiming to redesign the interface of the open-source, audio editing application, Audacity. The redesign is based on a user centric approach through surveys, task analysis and use cases.

A detailed report discusses the steps taken and provides both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the interface redesign process.

Two of the prototypes were "implemented" using java in the Netbeans IDE. Both have limited functionality due to the requirement that the implementation was in java (Audacity is written in C++) and the limited amount of time available/scope of the unit.
